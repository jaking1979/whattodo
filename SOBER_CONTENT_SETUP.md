# 🛡️ Sober Content Filtering - Setup Guide

## What's Been Implemented

Your Exchange now enforces **sober and family-friendly content only**!

### ✅ Features Added:

1. **Required Checkbox** - Publishers must confirm sober/family-friendly content
2. **Database Field** - `is_sober_content` boolean on all listings
3. **Server Validation** - API rejects non-sober content
4. **Auto-Filtering** - Exchange shows only sober-flagged content
5. **New Categories** - "Sober Activities" and "Wellness" options
6. **Admin Review** - `admin_approved` field for moderation

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Run This Migration Now!

You need to run the new SQL migration to add the sober content fields.

### Steps:

1. Go to: [https://fkjdzlrthtcwcjgbucca.supabase.co](https://fkjdzlrthtcwcjgbucca.supabase.co)

2. Click **SQL Editor**

3. Copy and paste this entire migration:
   ```sql
   -- File: supabase/migrations/003_sober_content.sql
   ```
   (Copy the full contents from `supabase/migrations/003_sober_content.sql`)

4. Click **Run**

5. Verify in **Database** → **Tables** → **marketplace_listings** that you see:
   - `is_sober_content` column (boolean)
   - `admin_approved` column (boolean, nullable)

---

## 🔒 How It Works

### Publishing to Exchange:

1. User clicks "Publish" on a public list
2. Dialog shows **"Sober/Family-Friendly Content"** checkbox (required)
3. User MUST check the box to proceed
4. Server validates the checkbox is true
5. If false → Error: "List must be marked as sober/family-friendly content"
6. If true → Published to Exchange ✅

### Browsing Exchange:

1. Exchange page filters: `.eq('is_sober_content', true)`
2. Only shows lists with sober flag = true
3. Empty state mentions "sober and family-friendly lists"
4. No non-sober content visible

### Categories:

New options in publish dialog:
- **Sober Activities** (new!)
- **Wellness** (new!)
- Movies
- Books  
- Games
- Podcasts
- Mixed

## 🚨 Moderation System

### Community Reporting:

Users can report non-sober content (already in database):
- Reports table exists
- Report with reason "Non-Sober Content"
- Admin can review reports

### Admin Review:

- `admin_approved` field added to marketplace_listings
- Values:
  - `null` = Not reviewed yet (default)
  - `true` = Approved by admin
  - `false` = Rejected by admin

### Future Enhancement (optional):

Add admin dashboard to:
- View all listings
- Approve/reject listings
- View reports
- Ban repeat offenders

## 💡 Why This Approach?

**Self-Reporting + Community Moderation:**
- Users self-certify content is sober/family-friendly
- Checkbox creates awareness and accountability  
- Community can report violations
- Admins can review and ban bad actors
- Low overhead, scales well

**Three-Layer Protection:**
1. **Required checkbox** - User must affirm
2. **Server validation** - API enforces the rule
3. **Database filter** - Only sober content shown
4. **Community reports** - Users can flag violations
